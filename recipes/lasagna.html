    <h3>Description:</h3>
    </p>
    <p>We took a couple shortcuts for this recipe by using store-bought marinara and boxed pasta sheets. It saves a ton
        of time without sacrificing any flavor. We think it's absolutely perfect as-is, but also understand some people
        are looking to make sauce from scratch.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375ยบ. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions
            until al dente, less 2 minutes. Drain and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking
            together. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook ground beef until no longer pink, breaking
            up with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and drain fat. Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano
            and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper, then add marinara and stir until warmed
            through. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper.
            Set aside.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>n a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce across the bottom of the dish, then top
            with a single layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a
            layer of meat sauce. Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles with meat sauce, Parmesan, and
            mozzarella. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 400ยบ and bake uncovered for 18 to 20
            minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Garnish with parsley before serving. </li>
        <p></p>
    </ol>
